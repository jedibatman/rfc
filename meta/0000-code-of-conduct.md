Adopt a code of conduct that declares a basis of expectations for community behaviour.

In the open source community, it is an established pattern to adopt and adhere to a code of conduct as a mechanism for establishing a basis of expecations with respect to community behaviour. I have taken time to research various open source projects that I have been exposed to over the years that I perceive to be a generally good role model of community behavior based on my own interactions and experiences. The projects *or* communities that I believe fall into this category are:

- [CNCF](https://github.com/cncf/foundation/blob/master/code-of-conduct.md)
- [Elixir](https://github.com/elixir-lang/elixir/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)
- [Python](https://www.python.org/psf/codeofconduct/)
- [Golang](https://golang.org/conduct)
- [Docker](https://github.com/docker/code-of-conduct)

Additionally, upon doing some googling to get a sense for what is out there with respect to open source code of conduct templates, I stumbled upon the [contributor covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/1/4/code-of-conduct). This covenant exists solely to promote the adoption of values of conduct that are inclusive, open, and welcoming in the open source community. It has seen adoption by a [vast](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/adopters) number of open source projects and is also either directly adopted, used as inspiration, or is derived from for the aforementioned projects / communities listed above.

Furthermore, when looking at this covenant through the lens of Topgolf's core values -- Fun, One Team, Edgy Spirit, Caring, and Excellence -- I do not believe there is anything of substance that is in conflict and, in fact, is in direct support of the covenant with respect to at least two of those values (One Team, Caring).

# Decision
[decision]: #decision

Adoption of the latest version ([1.4](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/1/4/code-of-conduct)) of the contributor covenant will be used going forward for all community contexts that are under the purvue of Topgolf Labs.

# Consequences
[consequences]: #consequences

What effects necessarily follow as a result of adoption of the decision made?

The conduct within all projects owned by the Topgolf Labs organization will adhere to the contributor covenant (version 1.4). Additionally, all projects owned by the Topgolf Labs organization shall maintain a copy of the the contributor covenant (version 1.4) located in the root of the project repository under the name `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`.
